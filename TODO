make sure all readbuffers check for NULL

optional hash validation

TODO cross platform serializations (especially for unicode; currently assuming that the UNICHR width is always 2
EDIT: perhaps a diff uni flagtype per width?

Go through each serializer and check the reference count of returned objects to ensure they make sense

trace all mallocs

see if we can remove the py_incref in pump.c; most serializations seem to have it set already (int / str might need it manually)
    If this is the case, throw some docs into README or wherever telling people to ensure that ref is 1 when ser terms


once we start doing py3 support; see about making the py2 dict serializer more efficient (look at dict_items)

None Type
Set Type
float Type
