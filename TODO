standardize docstrings:
    input: abc -

make sure all readbuffers check for NULL

signed int/long type

long overflow checking - either done as string in C, or in python

check serializing wonky unicode chars; alternately, in python require encoding, default to utf8

optional hash validation

alternatively, if all else fails for uni and long, use repr and a new type (for uni)
