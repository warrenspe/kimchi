/* DevNote: The memory format this library uses to serialize objects is as follows:
 *
 * [Type][Size][Serialization]
 *
 * Type: 1 byte.
 *     Bitflag representing what type was serialized here. See headers/kimchi.h for type definitions.
 *
 * Size: X bytes.
 *     The number of bytes the size field consumes is determined by the first byte which has its first bit set to 1.
 *     Example: [00001111][00000000][11111111] <- size is 3 bytes long; first byte with a 1 in the first position
 *              indicates that it is the final byte.  Note that only the first 7 bits of each byte contribute towards
 *              the value that is serialized in the size field (the first of each is just a continuation flag).
 *              It was implemented in this manner to be more frugal regarding the # of stored bytes; as using only
 *              7 bits per byte is more efficient than dedicating an entire byte to represent the length of the size
 *              field for all serialized objects up to 72057594037927936 (2**56) bytes in size. (The maximum we're able
 *              to serialize being 2**63).  Since we expect the vast majority of serialized objects to be of a size
 *              smaller than 2**56 it was implemented in this fashion.
 *
 * Serialization: {Size} bytes.
 *     The serialization of the object.  Certain objects (ex, iterables) have their own substructures in this section.
 */

/* DevNote: To extend this library with the capability to serialize further objects, the following steps must be taken.
 *     Follow the existing conventions in place in each of the files when making changes.
 *
 *     1. Add a new entry to kimchi/headers/kimchi.h: Type Definitions.
 *     2. Add an entry to if block chain in kimchi/utils/types.c discerning whether a generic python object is of your type.
 *     3. Add cases to the switches in kimchi/utils/serialize.c to serialize and deserialize objects of your type.
 *     4. Add a new file to kimchi/serializers/ to serialize & deserialize your type.
 *        Ensure that the Python Object returned from your deserialization has a ref count of 1.
 *     5. Add a new unit test for your type to the kimchi/tests/ directory.
 *        It will be automatically included in the unit tests.
